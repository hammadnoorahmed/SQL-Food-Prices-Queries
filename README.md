# SQL-Food-Prices-Queries
This is a case study for SQL Queries using operators and joins to get insights from data.

Folloing tasks are asked to be performed: 
Run the following queries on the food prices and commodities tables and submit your sql scripts.

● Select dates and commodities for cities Quetta, Karachi, and Peshawar where price was less than or equal 50 PKR

● Query to check number of observations against each market/city in PK

● Show number of distinct cities

● List down/show the names of cities in the table

● List down/show the names of commodities in the table

● List Average Prices for Wheat flour - Retail in EACH city separately over the entire period.

● Calculate summary stats (avg price, max price) for each city separately for all cities except Karachi and sort alphabetically the city names, commodity names where commodity is Wheat (does not matter which one) with separate rows for each commodity

● Calculate Avg_prices for each city for Wheat Retail and show only those avg_prices which are less than 30

● Prepare a table where you categorize prices based on a logic (price &lt; 30 is LOW, price &gt; 250 is HIGH, in between are FAIR)

● Create a query showing date, cmname, category, city, price, city_category where Logic for city category is: Karachi and Lahore
are &#39;Big City&#39;, Multan and Peshawar are &#39;Medium-sized city&#39;, Quetta is &#39;Small City&#39;

unfair if more than or equal to 100, if &gt; 300 then &#39;Speculative&#39;

● Join the food prices and commodities table with a left join.

● Join the food prices and commodities table with an inner join

Outputs are indicated. Moreover, full sql file along with the data file which was used is also uploaded.
